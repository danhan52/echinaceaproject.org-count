# echinaceaproject.org-count
The repository with the code for echinaceaproject.org/count and the
counting applications used by Team Echinacea. All subfolders represent different
pages within echinaceaproject.org/count

## acheneCounter
Used to count achenes at echinaceaproject.org/count/acheneCounter. Just add the
query string ?img=<URL-to-image> to the end of the regular URL to make it
open the image.

## xrayCounter
Used to count x-ray images at echinaceaproject.org/count/xrayCount. Just add
the query string ?img=<URL-to-image> to the end of the regular URL to make it
open the image.

## xrayTraining
A training program to teach people the difference between full, partial, and
empty achenes within an x-ray image. It randomly chooses from 40 possible images
and gives immediate feedback on if an achene was clicked and if the correct
type was clicked.
