The repository with the code for
[echinaceaproject.org/count](http://echinaceaproject.org/count) and the
counting applications used by Team Echinacea. All subfolders represent different
pages within echinaceaproject.org/count

## acheneCounter
Used to count achenes at
[echinaceaproject.org/count/acheneCounter](http://echinaceaproject.org/count/acheneCounter).
Just add the query string ?img=<URL-to-image> to the end of the regular URL to
make it open the image.

## xrayCounter
Used to count x-ray images at
[echinaceaproject.org/count/xrayCount](http://echinaceaproject.org/count/xrayCount).
Just add the query string ?img=<URL-to-image> to the end of the regular URL to
make it open the image.

## xrayTraining
A training program to teach people the difference between full, partial, and
empty achenes within an x-ray image. It randomly chooses from 40 possible images
and gives immediate feedback on if an achene was clicked and if the correct
type was clicked. It's found at
[echinaceaproject.org/count/xrayTraining](http://echinaceaproject.org/count/xrayTraining)
