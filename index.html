  <h1 class="center2">Echinacea Project counting applications</h1>

  <p class="center2">
    <span class="sectionTitle">Basic information</span><br>
    Welcome to the page for the Echinacea Project's counting applications.
    Currently, we have two applications available, one for counting achenes
    (or any single object in a picture), and another for counting x-ray images
    (or anything with three categories of object).<br><br>

    You can find the achene counting application at
    <a href="http://echinaceaproject.org/count/acheneCounter">
      http://echinaceaproject.org/count/acheneCounter
    </a>
    and you can find the x-ray counting application at
    <a href="http://echinaceaproject.org/count/xrayCounter">
      http://echinaceaproject.org/count/xrayCounter
    </a>.<br><br>

    <span class="sectionTitle">Using your own images</span><br>
    When using the applications, you need to add a file path in order for an
    image to appear. For example, if you want to count achenes in the image
    located at
    <a href="http://echinaceaproject.org/count/scanImages/example.jpg">
      http://echinaceaproject.org/count/scanImages/example.jpg
    </a>
    you need to add <br>"?img=http://echinaceaproject.org/count/scanImages/k1891nf.jpg"
    to the URL giving you<br>
    <a href="http://echinaceaproject.org/count/acheneCounter?img=http://echinaceaproject.org/count/scanImages/example.jpg">
      http://echinaceaproject.org/count/acheneCounter?img=http://echinaceaproject.org/count/scanImages/example.jpg
    </a><br>
    Similarly, for the x-ray counter, you might use the URL<br>
    <a href="http://echinaceaproject.org/count/xrayCounter?img=http://echinaceaproject.org/count/xrayImages/example.jpg">
      http://echinaceaproject.org/count/xrayCounter?img=http://echinaceaproject.org/count/xrayImages/example.jpg
    </a><br><br>

    So in summary, use one of the two URLs list above and tack "img=&lt;yourImageURL&gt;"
    onto the end.<br><br>

    <span class="sectionTitle">How to use the applications</span><br>
    In both applications, a single left click will add a point, and a double click
    will remove all points that are close to where you clicked. When double clicking
    you may see a new circle appear briefly, don't worry about it, it gets deleted
    as soon as you double click.<br>
    In the achene counter application there are zoom buttons to change the size
    of the image. Don't zoom in too far or the image quality will get a lot worse.
    In the x-ray counter, you can count three types of objects. In order to switch
    between counting full, partial, or empty achenes, either click the
    "Switch Counting Type" button, or press the key 's'. Note that the double
    click feature works on all points, no matter what is displayed after
    "Now counting:" <br><br>

    <span id="happy"> Happy counting!</span>
